  This site looks at just some of the data out there about vaccines
  and illness. It tries to compile it into a format that can be interacted
  with, hopefully for a better understanding of how risk-benefit decisions
  work.
baseurl: "/no-bricks" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://stonesunturned.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
github_username:  stonesunturned
