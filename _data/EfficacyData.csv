JA Marks. TJ Halpin TJ. WA Orenstein,Measles vaccine efficacy in children previously vaccinated at 12 months of age,1978,Pediatrics,Epidemiological,true,true,false,false,CDC; Ohio Department of Health,71,95.5,false,http://pediatrics.aappublications.org.libproxy.ucl.ac.uk/content/62/6/955,North America,Vaccination was moved from 9 months to 12 when it was discovered that low levels of maternal antibodies at 12 months could interfere with efficacy and efficacy at 12 months reported here. Adjusts for vaccinations that occurred during the outbreak. Children with multiple vaccinations were excluded from study.

Coverage varies widely by state
FJ Luquero et al.,A Long-Lasting Measles Epidemic in Maroua Cameroon 2008–2009: Mass Vaccination as Response to the Epidemic,2008,Journal of Infectious Diseases,Case-control,true,true,true,false,WHO; MSF,2963,94,false,http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/204/suppl_1/S243.full,Africa,Study done as part of an outbreak in Maroua area; found high measles incidence in regions with 71% coverage and lower incidence where 84% coverage. Following outbreak response immunization program coverage was >90% and incidence decreased rapidly.  Not all measles cases could be serologically confirmed so may be over-reported
DE Sugerman et al.,Preplanned National Measles Vaccination Campaign at the Beginning of a Measles Outbreak—Sierra Leone; 2009–2010,2010,Journal of Infectious Diseases,Epidemiological,true,true,true,false,CDC; WHO; UNICEF,424,74,false,http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/204/suppl_1/S260.full,Africa,Includes vaccination in children under 12 months where long-term immunity lower. Additional vaccinations needed in these cases and may not have been obtained and account for the lower efficacy. Proportion population vaccinated was calculated from 2004-2008 WHO and UNICEF estimates assumed to be 68%. Over half of cases had unknown vaccination status and were assumed to be unvaccinated.

Coverage of 89% taken from 2 year-olds in cNICS.

Children who were young at the time of study may still have been protected by maternal antibodies.

Efficacy evaluated for children 9 months to 13 years. Efficacy here is for children with known vaccination status excluding those with history of measles although the paper reports a range of values for other cohorts and assumptions.

It is worth noting that Krugman was later found to be conducting unethical studies for Hepatitis in this same school for children with intellectual disabilities. Unclear whether children less than 12 mos were included but unlikely given study design. Merck performed antibody tests but no indication they funded study.
