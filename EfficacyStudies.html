		<h2>Under construction</h2>
		<p>I hope to compile the wealth of information about vaccine efficacy from various sources into an interactive graph that can be filtered based on type of study, country of participants, funding body, etc. Sources would include a variety of scientific studies (starting point will be those cited in the <a href="http://www.cochrane.org/CD004407/ARI_using-combined-vaccine-protection-children-against-measles-mumps-and-rubella">Cochrane reviews</a>), <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6236a2.htm">outbreak</a> <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6322a4.htm?s_cid=mm6322a4_w">data</a> combined with vaccine coverage estimates and so on. A whole bunch of US monitoring data from <a href="https://www.tycho.pitt.edu/">Project Tycho</a> recently became available, so that's exciting. This is something of a large project though.</p>
