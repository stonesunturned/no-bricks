<!-- I can probably do this much nicer with a grid layout and show an image, title and brief description for each, like here: https://rsms.me/ Should be able to use panels from bootstrap-->
<p>If you've been through the explanations section, you've had a lot of numbers thrown at you, but where did they come from? How reasonable are they? Here are a few pages summarizing information sources. Keep in mind that this is not an exhaustive list.</p>

<ul class="post-list">
	{% for my_page in site.pages %}
		{% if my_page.inStudies %}
			<li>
				<h2><a class="page-link" href="{{ my_page.url | prepend: site.github.url }}">{{ my_page.title }}</a></h2>
				<p>{{ my_page.excerpt }}</p>
			</li>
		{% endif %}
	{% endfor %}
</ul>
